          <h3>Gig @ Carnegie Hall</h3>
          <p>
              Last night we played the most epic gig ever at maybe our favorite venue of all times. The audience was amazing and we had a great time! Thanks to all who showed up.

          <h3>In the studio</h3>
          <p>
            We have been spending a lot of time in the studio the last few weeks. Yesterday we finsihed the final vocal tracks on our latest song: "Life is crate, Ham-crate". This will be released next summer on our new record
            and hopefully it will be ready for streaming this christmas.

          <h3>Gig @ Franks backyard</h3>
          <p>
              As you may know, Franks mom is our number 1 fan (in her own mind) and since this is the truth we like to take care of our number 1 fan. So, last night we played an intimate concert in Franks childhood home to celebrate
            his moms 60th birthday. There were around 50 close friends and family present for the celebration and we had a great time!
