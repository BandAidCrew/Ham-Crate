        <h2>2. Changes</h2>
        <p>
          Note that the subsections include changes to the corresponding css and js files.
        </p>
        <h3>Changes throughout the webpage</h3>
        <p>
          We decided to change the layout of the menu bar in all of the pages. This was primarily done to increase the visibility of the text and create a more continuous page. It was also done because we chose that all text that was a link should be red, so to continue this feature throughout the pages, it was better to make the text red instead of having it inside a red box. Instead we made the box in the color of the top element on the page. That way the link color was continued and we increased usability by making it easy for the user to always know what page he or she is on.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the scope of this project we only had time to make the website look as good as possible for use on computers with larger screens. This means that one of the things that was important to us, making the web page mobile friendly, was not done in a satisfactory way. In our initial mockup we wanted to create a hamburger menu bar for all mobile devices. We were not able to do this because of limited time for this project. This is however something we would prioritize to fix, if we had more time available. We did however make the page elements adapt to the size of the screen, so we started a process of making the web page mobile friendly, but this was unfortunately not completed as well as we wanted to.
        </p>
        <h3>Changes to index.html</h3>
        <p>
          We decided to make the pictures of the band shaped like circles instead of squares. This was done because the band liked the overall layout of the front page better with this type of picture-framing. And it gives a much cleaner look to the whole first impression of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make the sections for photos and videos on the front page not look like one element, we created a darker background for the photos part of the page. This was also done so the pictures was easier to view in a satisfactory way.
        </p>
        <h3>Changes to about.html</h3>
        <p>
          Initially there has been few changes to the overall about page, as it was from the beginning very straight forward. The band picture has been styled to be covering the whole first part of the page, as it was seen after some testing as a more stylish and elegant solution. Some changes were made to how the bio of the members appear. The bio for each member will be under the profile picture instead of the left or right side. This was done mainly because of simplicity, and works well with how the page responds when shrunk down in size.
        </p>
        <h3>Changes to blog.html</h3>
        <p>
          In our initial mockup of the blog page we wanted to have a div element on the right side which would consist of archive of previous posts sorted into folders for different years and months. We decided to remove this element because it did not work well with the kind of image the band wanted for its page. The blog was made mainly for new visitors to read about what has been going on lately and for fans to find a gig they just went to. The point was not for people to be able to go back a long time in history, but only get the freshest information, always. So the blog page will consist of  the 10 latest posts. That was what the band wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also made it possible to click the image from the blogpost to view it in full screen size for better visibility and for the users viewing pleasure.
        </p>
        <h3>Changes to merchandise.html</h3>
        <p>
          Merchandise.html has been changed quite a lot to include a rectangular box for each product. The boxes have fixed size of 200px x 250px, and boxes fill up each “line” of the weppage. Info about purchase is moved to the top.
        </p>
        <h3>Changes to music.html</h3>
        <p>
          No significant changes from the changes document was made to this page.
        </p>
        <h3>Changes to photos.html</h3>
        <p>
          To make the viewing experience more pleasurable we changed the size of the thumbnails from 166x166px to having a width of 300px. This made the pictures more visible and it made it possible to see what the picture contained without having to open the image slideshow. We also made it so the photos page was a page that contained all the different albums that you could choose from and you could click the one you wanted to check out. Once an album was opened, a new page with all the pictures from this certain gig or event would be shown. Here you could press the picture you wanted to view in a large format and you could move through the album in a slideshow. This was done to make the viewing experience easier and more manageable. This way it is easier for the fans to find the exact album they are looking for without having to search for a long time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also went away from the initial plan to have an automatic slideshow start when you pressed a picture. This was done so that the user could choose the speed for viewing pictures himself and could use longer time viewing one picture if that was what he wanted.
        </p>
        <h3>Changes to videos.html</h3>
        <p>
          In the videos page we decided to structure the page with the videos underneath each other so it would be easier to find the newest video that was added first. We also decided to make the videos bigger (now 560x315px) for a better viewing experience if you did not want to view the video in full screen. We also decided not to make the videos fill the page once you started viewing it because youtube already has this feature implemented in its player, and we do not need to reinvent the wheel when somebody has already done a good job. The band also wanted to post all their videos to youtube so it was easier to share the videos across different platforms and social medias. That is why we have not decided to show the videos from our own server and make the code for it ourself, even though we most definitely could.
        </p>
        <h3>Changes to events.html</h3>
        <p>
          No significant changes from the changes document was made to this page.

        <h2>3. Fulfillment of minimum Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Henry fulfilled his JavaScript requirements with making a lightbox function that opens a picture to fullscreen and shades the webpage in the back to a dark opaque background. Daniel made the user be able to click a band member on the front page to be able to get more information about this certain member, with the page-element adapting to the size of the text for each member. Nils made a script so the menu bar always stays on top of the page, even if you scroll down. Magnus made a function to be able to view all the pictures in a fullscreen slideshow where you can maneuver between the pictures. All of the group members made the html files and its css files according to the plan made initially and which can be viewed in the next section for work division.

        <h2>5. Handling of modularity requirements</h2>

        <p>
          JavaScript has been used to implement client-side includes, which enables a higher degree of modularity. Code from https://github.com/LexmarkWeb/csi.js/tree/master has been used. This code ensures that when an element containing a “data-include” attribute is encountered encountered, HTML code is included from the value of this attribute. In this way, parts of the body and footer are common for all pages in the site. The client-side include implementation is suitable for testing purposes, but should not be used in actual production.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a file “main.css” which apply styles to common classes. All of our web pages use classes defined in this file, in order to get a uniform and consistent style throughout the webpages, and without copying code. Examples are the .lightBackground and .darkBackground classes, which contain defined colors and padding.
