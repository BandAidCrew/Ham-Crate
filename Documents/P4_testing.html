            <h2>Administrative details</h2>
            <p>
                Client: Ham Crate
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Website name: Ham Crate
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Contact person: Frank Crate, founder and front figure for the band

        <section>
            <h2>Testing Document</h2>
            <p>
                Link to the Google form <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdzaLB6zhKAZTiFqiCJv6Laip4q9OXchFWsXH8I-sUWv2dM-A/viewform">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We decided to make the form as concise as possible, to ensure that as many as possible would answer it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first part of the form contained background information, such as gender, age and the device being used. All of these questions were compulsory, so that the interpretation of the data would be easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part contained the actual feedback. The first questions termed if there were any errors loading the page. Furthermore, questions regarding different aspects of the web page such as design, navigation, content and usability were made in a “grid-like” fashion. Users were able to answer questions on a scale with five options.  We tried to make questions that were relatively easy to answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, we added an option to comment anything on the webpage. This increases the probability that important feedback will be received.

            <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
            <p>
                During our testing we asked people we knew to take a look at the site and give some feedback. We made a google form to make the responding easy for our test subjects. Since most of our group is slightly above the intended audience age, we also got some feedback from people that are slightly above the intended audience age. The feedback we got had the following age:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>22-25 years (66.7%)</li>
                <li>26-29 years (25%)</li>
                <li>30-40 years (8.3%)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The positive thing is that we got feedback from a variety of ages and therefore get to to see if we can meet the needs of a larger scope than intended. This is something that we will be able to sell to the band, that we have made a site that a lot of different ages like, not only the first intended audience.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also asked about the current situation of our test subjects and got the following answers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Students in higher education (university, college etc.) (50%)</li>
                <li>Working (41.7%)</li>
                <li>Unemployed (8.3%)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This is within our scope for the audience of our site, primarily young people, typically students, but also for people that are working or unemployed for the moment. We think this makes the testing successful if we look at who we have made the site for.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were also able to talk to some of our test subjects as they looked at the website so we could note down comments and initial thoughts they had as they looked through all the different pages. Some of these comments can be found in the feedback summary.
            </p>

            <h2>Testing Platforms</h2>
            <p>
                The test subjects used primarily four different platforms:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A computer with Chrome (33.3%)</li>
                <li>A computer with Firefox (16.7%)</li>
                <li>An iPhone (25%)</li>
                <li>A phone running an Android OS (25%)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
            <p>
                <h3>Design</h3>

                Most of our test subjects were satisfied with the overall layout and colors of the site. We got some feedback that the menu bar and other elements were too small and that it shifted position during testing. Several respondents replied that the site looked messy.

                <h3>Navigation</h3>

                A majority of our tester thought it was easy to navigate through the website. During testing were there was one of the developers present we got feedback like that there should be a return button to get out of an album to the album overview page and that it was a bit difficult to know how to get out of the slideshow.

                <h3>Content</h3>

                The test subjects agreed that it was easy to find information (all but one person replied this). Since some of the pages only had a filler text, since the band had not provided the real text yet, we got one reply that the information supplied was not really relevant since it only said “lorem ipsum…”. The test subjects seemed to be satisfied with the content.

                <h3>Usability</h3>

                Some complained that the loading time was too long. The comments made about the menu bar is also applicable to this element of feedback. Other than that the response seemed to be positive.

            </p>

            <h2>Your Response</h2>
            <p>
                Some of the suggestions are relatively easy to implement. This includes making the menu bar bigger and making a return button from the album page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the loading issues could be improved by compressing the content. However, the loading would most likely be more smooth if we were allowed to use a templating engine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some noted that the website looked messy. Improving this would most likely require redesigning a lot on the site, which is time-consuming. Furthermore, whether the site looks messy is also an individual question. However, if we had enough time, we could have come with new design suggestions with a tighter cooperation with our customer and potential users.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we were restricted on which tools we were allowed to use, some feedback is more difficult to tackle.
            </p>

            <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
            <p>
                We feel like we learned a lot during this project period. Maybe first of all that a project like this works very bad with using a sort of waterfall method. It is a bit optimistic to expect that you can get all the requirements and design features set at the beginning of the project. As the project went along we saw that there were some things that we could not do because of lack of time and we got ideas for what we could do different or better. The band also made changes to their initial demands so we had to adapt as we went along. That is why we feel like a project like this is not very realistic in the ways that we work, but an experience to learn from none the less.
            </p>
            <p>
                The group worked well with different levels of previous experience and interests. We divided the workload well between ourselves to make sure that there was not that one guy that had to do everything. One thing we did that we will take with us as a good idea was that we had meetings every week where we updated each other on what had been done since the last time we met and our plans for the next working period. This was also a place where we could ask for help, or brainstorm new ideas or demands from the client. A very positive experience to sum up.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also learned during this project that user testing is very important. We think that in a future project like this it would be a good idea to finish the work needed to be done earlier, so we could use more time on precise and rigorous testing. When you have looked at the pages and the code for a long time, it is difficult to see all the different things that should be altered. User testing can provide some useful insight on things that should be done differently or better. We are making it for the users, not ourself, so they should be able to give more feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                All in all we are satisfied with the outcome of this project and the webpage we were able to make during such a short time period.
