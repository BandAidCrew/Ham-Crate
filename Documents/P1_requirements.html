          The band would not like a typical web page from the 70’s with a lot of menus, boring fonts and colors like <a href="greenday.com">greenday.com</a> or <a href="jamiroquai.com">jamiroquai.com</a>. They would preferably like a page where everything
          is on one page and menu elements in the header links to a different part of the same page.
