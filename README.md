## About
Welcome to the promotion-website for the talented up-and-coming band "Ham-Crate".
The webpage is made by the team "BandAidCrew" consisting of:
  - Lundeby, Daniel
  - Sj√∏en, Henry S.
  - Vatne, Magnus Nesje
  - Ulvund, Nils Joakim

## Hosting the site locally
The site needs a server that supports simple post/get-requests.
This is needed for our simple template-engine to work.
Therefore if you want to host the website on your computer (for dev-purposes)
you may run a simple server with python.

Open a terminal, navigate to the projects root-folder and run the command:
`python3 -m http.server
`
The website should then be served at localhost:8000

## Quick Folder structure overview
Each document should have a quick explanation of its purpose in the top-section of the file.
